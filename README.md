Uber clone built with react native and Typescript. You can select the place of origin and destination thanks to the Google API, as well as calculate the price according to the distance between the places and the quality of the service.

##TODO:
-  It is necessary to fix zoom out in map wht two marks are selected.
- It is necessary to modify icon image to svg icon as component.
